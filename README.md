# sharpe-assistant
An earpiece voice assistant. A voice-operated asynchronous agent network meant to make work light by leveraging agents for working on multiple things at once.

OpenManus Functionality:
- [X] Get OpenManus working 
- [X] Add generic output write of internal knowledge so far direct to markdown on failure to write before last step 
    - This was built in to OpenManus 

Due to current limitations in LLMs, commands should be effectively O(1) (i.e. instantly have a task, goal, context, and tool in mind) to keep speed managable

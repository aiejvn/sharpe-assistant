Prompt: Find and summarize the best deck for each mastermind in Resident Evil: Resistance. Summarize output in a markdown file.

Apparently we need to install Playwright? Otherwise OpenManus uses Beautiful Soup.
There's 20 steps and they're all painfully slow.

Manus also displays its thoughts. Seems to be a chain-of-thought architecture.

First run: Manus selected 0 tools to use :skull:
	- Failed. Used 0.07 cents (~71k tokens)

Second run: more success. It just needed playwright, lol.
	- It has no tools for watching videos
	- OpenManus found a playlist, found videos, but kept reading the descriptions
		- We could work on OpenManus parsing videos
	- Steps seem to be less so a process and more a call stack cap

Third run: Added to prompt to summarize findings in a markdown file - it did not. We should test how it works on non-video-related tasks.

Fourth run: Used 'python run_mcp.py' instead.

	- Path error?
	- Let's try doubling number of steps

	- Output is only saved if Manus decides in its last step to save the result.
